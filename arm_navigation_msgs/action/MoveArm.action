# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will allow move_arm to accept plans that do not go all the way to the goal

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will allow move_arm to accept invalid goals
# This is useful if you are using a planner like CHOMP along with a noisy rapidly changing collision map
# and you would like to plan to a goal near an object.

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will disable the call to IK for a pose goal
